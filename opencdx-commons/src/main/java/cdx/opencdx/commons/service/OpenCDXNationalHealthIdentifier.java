 * The OpenCDXNationalHealthIdentifier interface serves as a blueprint for creating National Health ID for users in the OpenCDX system.

 * @implNote The current approach involves generation of a {@link java.util.UUID} based on a user's email and further conversion to a {@link String}.
 * @implSpec The creation of this interface is to facilitate the development of an agnostic mechanism to generate a National Health Identifier since no standard method exists currently.
 *           Being a string, this identifier can be easily shared. Nonetheless, it is important to bear in the mind the risk of collisions, which should be prevented through proper care.

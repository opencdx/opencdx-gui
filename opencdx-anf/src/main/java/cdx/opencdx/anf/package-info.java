/**
 * This microservice is responsible for persisting Alternate Normal Form (ANF) statements.
 * ANF is a method applied in structuring data held within HL7 v2 messages, aiming to enhance its applicability for data analysis. It predominantly involves the categorization of data elements into more manageable, logical segments, driven by their interrelationships and usage frequency. This practice facilitates an improved understanding and manipulation of data, as well as an elevated ease of analysis, as opposed to the flat, linear structure characteristic of traditional HL7 v2 messages.

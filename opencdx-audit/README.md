## Interfaces
**OpenCDXAuditMessageHandler** - Handler for receiving messages from the OpenCDXMessageService, then processes them into an AuditEvent object. Currently this Interface outputs ALL AuditEvents to the log. A production implementation would want to implement a complete solution here to properly store and process the AuditEvent records.
